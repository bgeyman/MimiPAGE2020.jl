# PAGE-2020 - Open-Source Repository for the PAGE-2020 Integrated Assessment Model

![](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl/workflows/Run%20CI%20on%20master/badge.svg)

PAGE-2020 (Policy Analysis of Greenhouse Effect, v. 2020) is a
cost-benefit Integrated Assessment Model. It builds upon
the [PAGE-ICE model](https://github.com/openmodels/PAGE-ICE/),
developed by
[Yumashev et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09863-x#Sec14).

The main advancements for the PAGE-2020 are:
 - Extended and corrected SSP data
 - Improved market damages, based on Burke et al. (2015).
 - Partial growth feedbacks
 - Optional annual timesteps and variability

## Getting started

For software requirements, installation instructions, and basic usage,
see the [Getting started](https://github.com/openmodels/PAGE-2020/tree/master/docs/getting-started.md) page.

Information on computing an SCC in PAGE-2020 is available in
the [Calculating the Social Cost of Carbon](https://github.com/openmodels/PAGE-2020/tree/master/docs/calc-scc.m)] page.

## Running the Model

It is recommended to read the Mimi documentation first to understand
the code structure. For starter code on running the model just once,
see the code in the file `examples/main.jl`.

## More documentation

More documentation is available under the [docs](https://github.com/openmodels/PAGE-2020/tree/master/docs) directory.
